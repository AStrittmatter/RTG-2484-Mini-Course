# *Machine Learning for Economists and Business Analysts*

Standard machine learning methods are powerful prediction tools, but they cannot be deployed for causal inference without putting additional structure on the estimation problem. This course provides a practical introduction to predictive and causal machine learning. In the first part of the course, we focus on supervised machine learning methods. We discuss penalized regression and tree-based methods. In the second part of the course, we discuss how machine learning can be combined with causal inference. In particular, we focus on methods that allow to control for high-dimensional confounders in a data-driven way (double selection procedure, T-learning, double machine learning). We solve real-world  economic and business problems in practical R session, which are integral part of the course.
